Keep the way you work consistent across coding agents and workspaces. Agent Deck gives every agent the right playbooks, tools, and credentials from one governed source of truth.

## Why

You teach one coding agent how you work: how to open a PR, write a ticket, check a release, or use your knowledge base. Then you switch to another agent and teach it all again. Move to a different workspace and the same procedures are copied, drift, or disappear into old chat threads.

**Consistency across agents.** The same playbook can guide Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or another MCP client. You maintain one procedure instead of separate copies for every agent.

**Consistency across workspaces.** Reusable PR rules, ticketing procedures, UI principles, and knowledge-base workflows live in one collection. Attach them to the decks that need them instead of duplicating them across repositories.

**One governed source of truth.** A deck bundles the MCP services, credentials, and playbooks for one context. The agent sees only that deck. When you correct a playbook-driven result, Agent Deck turns the lesson into a reviewable patch proposal so future sessions start from what you taught it.

One MCP endpoint, registered once. Switch decks instead of rewiring agents; improve a playbook once and reuse the lesson everywhere.

### Run your day through it

[agent-dealer](https://github.com/not-so-fat/agent-dealer) is the execution half: queue tasks against a deck, approve the plan before anything runs, execute headless under budget caps, review results, and gate every outbound send. Dealer runs consume deck playbooks and file patch proposals back — every run makes the next one better. ([Direction](docs/DIRECTION.md))

## Quick Start

> **⚠️ macOS required.** API key secrets, OAuth client secrets, and OAuth tokens are stored in **macOS Keychain**. Linux and Windows are not supported for production use yet ([dev file fallback only](docs/SETUP.md#secrets--oauth-storage)).

**Requirements:** Node.js 20+ · npm · Dashboard via `agent-deck start` / `agent-deck open` (listens on `127.0.0.1:1111`) · Agent Deck MCP `http://127.0.0.1:1110/mcp`

### 1. Install and launch

**Recommended (managed install — auto-updates, keeps existing `~/.agent-deck` data):**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/not-so-fat/agent_deck/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
# or: npx @agent-deck/cli@latest install
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
agent-deck start --daemon
```

Compat: `npm install -g @agent-deck/cli` still works; `agent-deck install` switches only the CLI binary (no data migration).

`start` opens the dashboard with a one-shot bootstrap cookie (do **not** type bare `http://127.0.0.1:1111` — that shows the dashboard recovery view). Day to day: `agent-deck start --daemon` / `agent-deck open` / `agent-deck stop` · `agent-deck status` if something fails. Use plain `agent-deck start` when you want a foreground process (logs to stdout). Headless: `--no-open` or `AGENT_DECK_NO_OPEN=1`.

### 2. Register Agent Deck in your agent

Your host needs an Agent Deck MCP transport—not direct registrations for Linear, Notion, or other downstream services. The Codex plugin supplies `agent-deck mcp-launch`; Cursor and Claude setup write their host configuration. Without that transport, chat cannot reach your decks or collection.

**Three layers** (one-time host setup, optional folder assignment, then session bootstrap):

| Command | When | What it does |
|---------|------|----------------|
| **`setup`** | **Once** per machine | Host MCP configuration where applicable + [agent harness](docs/AGENT_HARNESS.md). For Codex, marker-merges `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`; the plugin owns MCP transport. |
| **`use <deck>`** | Once per IDE repo unless the launcher selects a deck | Folder assignment (`.agent-deck/use.json`) + thin **trigger stubs** for better implicit playbook matching — bodies still live on the deck |

Use `agent-deck use <deck>` for ordinary IDE folders so `mcp-launch` can select the deck before MCP initializes. Launch-selected unattended sessions may supply the deck header directly and intentionally omit the assignment file.

`setup` also installs the terminal status line by default for Cursor CLI and Claude Code (`--no-statusline` to skip). Muse has no Agent Deck status line.

#### Codex

Install and enable the Agent Deck plugin, then install the global bootstrap guidance:

```bash
agent-deck setup --client codex    # merges ~/.codex/AGENTS.md; does not install the plugin
```

Optional per repo: `agent-deck use my-deck` writes `.agent-deck/use.json`. Start a new Codex task after setup so Codex rebuilds its instruction chain and reloads the plugin connection.

#### Cursor

```bash
agent-deck setup --client cursor    # once
```

Optional per repo: `agent-deck use my-deck` → project `.cursor/mcp.json`, stubs under `.cursor/rules/agent-deck-stubs/`

Or **Settings → Tools & MCP → Add custom MCP** (HTTP) with the URL above. **Restart Cursor** — `agent-deck` should show connected while `agent-deck start` is running.

#### Claude Code

```bash
agent-deck setup --client claude    # once
```

Optional per repo: `agent-deck use my-deck` → `.mcp.json`, stubs under `.claude/skills/agent-deck-*/`

**Restart Claude Code**, then `claude mcp list` — `agent-deck` should be **Connected**.

#### Muse

```bash
agent-deck setup --client muse    # once: MCP + native bootstrap skills
```

Optional per repo: `agent-deck use my-deck --client muse` → `.mcp.json` + `.agent-deck/use.json`; `agent-deck setup --client muse --scope project` merges root `AGENTS.md` (trust the workspace so Muse loads it).

**Start a new Muse process** (restart Muse) after setup, then `/mcp` should show `agent-deck`. First turn: the agent calls `get_session_context` once and shows exactly one verbatim `display_summary` line. Muse has no Agent Deck status line or plugin install — the transcript receipt is the binding record.

If you use `use` and accept playbook patches that change **triggers**, run `agent-deck use --refresh` in that repo (or ask the agent to).

### 3. Create a deck

<img src="./misc/UI.png" alt="Dashboard — collection and deck fan" width="70%" />

A **deck** bundles external MCP servers, API keys, and playbooks for one context (e.g. “work”, “this client”).

**Dashboard:** **My Decks** → create a deck → drag cards from **My Collection** (after steps 4–5).

**Agent chat:** ask the agent to create a deck and add cards.

### 4. Register playbooks (agent-first)

Describe the procedure in chat — e.g. *“Add a release checklist playbook with trigger ‘ship to npm’.”* Let the agent register it and attach it to your deck. It can refine the playbook from your feedback over time.

The dashboard can add playbooks too; chat authoring usually works better. Corrections become **proposals** you review in the dashboard (Playbook patches); accepted changes update the deck. If you use per-repo `use` stubs and triggers changed, refresh with `agent-deck use --refresh`.

### 5. Add external MCP servers and API keys

Third-party services (Linear, Notion, Slack, …) — **not** `:1110`, which is only the Agent Deck proxy.

| What | Metadata | Secrets / OAuth |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **External MCP** | Agent or dashboard | **Dashboard** — OAuth in browser |
| **API key** | Agent or dashboard | **Dashboard** — paste once into Keychain |

Drag cards onto your deck in the dashboard, or ask the agent when building the deck.

### 6. Pick a deck each session

**Default (agent-operated):** no repo config required. Tell the agent which deck — *“use the dev deck”*, *“work deck for this project”*, or mid-session *“switch to my personal deck”*. It calls `switch_deck` over MCP and waits for you to approve the switch as This session only or This workspace by default.

**Optional `agent-deck use`:** writes `.agent-deck/use.json` so the agent can bind that deck on session open without you naming it; trigger stubs improve playbook matching.

Terminal agents show the active deck in the footer (`◆ dev · 2 MCP · …`). If it stays unbound, check `agent-deck start` and that the deck exists in **My Decks**.

### Same decks across machines

None of these paths is mandatory. Pick by how you want persistence to work:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Git-backed file-store sync (recommended)** | Local-first: same decks across machines **without** hosting Agent Deck in the cloud |
| **Personal cloud hosting (optional)** | Always-on authenticated MCP endpoint when you want Agent Deck reachable remotely |
| **Export / import (one-shot)** | Move or share a layout once — not ongoing sync ([Data & portability](#data--portability)) |

**Recommended non-cloud workflow:** put the Agent Deck store (`~/.agent-deck/` in production) in a **private Git repository you own**. Commit and push on one machine after edits; pull on another; then run `agent-deck reindex` or restart the backend. **Agent Deck never runs Git** and does not resolve merge conflicts — fix conflicts in Git, then reindex.

**Safe to commit:** `manifest.json` plus the documented card/deck directories (`playbooks/`, `services/`, `credentials/`, `decks/`). Credential files are metadata only. **Keep machine-local / uncommitted:** SQLite and cache files (`*.db`, `*.db-*`), Keychain secrets, and OAuth tokens (re-enter or reconnect on each new machine).

Layout, `.gitignore`, conflicts, and reindex details: [Store format](docs/STORE_FORMAT.md).

## Reference

For contributors, dev ports (`:3000` / `:8000` / `:3001`) and env vars → [Setup](docs/SETUP.md) · [Development](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).

**Dashboard:** collection + deck editor · OAuth and API key secrets (Keychain) · per-tool toggles · export/import layouts (`.agent-deck.json`, no secrets) · collection warnings.

**Agent MCP** (`http://127.0.0.1:1110/mcp`): decks, collection, external MCP proxy, playbooks. Secrets, OAuth, and deletes stay on dashboard/CLI. Tool catalog → [MVP](docs/MVP.md).

**CLI:** `agent-deck use` · `agent-deck export` / `import` · `credential` · `exec` (inject keys) · `upgrade`

### Data & portability

Collection and decks live as files under `~/.agent-deck/` (playbooks as `.md`, services/decks as JSON, credential metadata as YAML). For ongoing multi-machine sync without cloud hosting, use **[Git-backed file-store sync](#same-decks-across-machines)** (recommended). For a one-shot move or sharing a deck template without Git, use `.agent-deck.json` export/import ([format](docs/STORE_FORMAT.md) · [export PRD](docs/PRD_EXPORT_IMPORT.md)).

## Install & run

After first-time [Quick Start](#quick-start):

```bash
agent-deck start
agent-deck open          # re-open dashboard with a fresh auth cookie
agent-deck upgrade
agent-deck stop
```

`start` opens the dashboard with a one-shot bootstrap cookie by default (`--no-open` for CI / headless). Bare `http://127.0.0.1:1111` without a launch pass shows the dashboard recovery view (**Open your dashboard securely**, with an **Open dashboard** action and the `agent-deck open` fallback) — that is **not** the MCP `GRANT_REQUIRED` case (**No deck selected for this connection**; fix with `agent-deck use <deck>` in the workspace so the launcher can send the deck header). Re-open anytime with `agent-deck open`.

Port conflicts: `agent-deck status` · `agent-deck start --force`
